# Kubernetes-Minikube
In this repository, I will document preparing the reuquirement infrustructure and resources as well as the installation path for a minikube and a complete Kubernetes cluster with one controlplane and two worker nodes. 
Besides, we take a look at how to reach the applications and services on these clusters.

Later on, I will use Ansible playbooks to automate the preparation and configurations.
